This project presents a Python-based technical analysis of Bitcoin using
TA-Lib indicators and volume-based analytics.

## 📄 Project overview
The objective is to analyze Bitcoin market structure using:
- Trend indicators (MA50 / MA200)
- Momentum indicators (RSI)
- Volatility (ATR)
- Volume Profile analysis

This is a personal first try for research and analysis project, not a trading system, and I acknowledge it can be greatly improved 🙏🏻
 

## 🔍 Indicators used
- Moving Averages (50 / 200)
- RSI (14)

The focus is on regime identification rather than short-term prediction.
